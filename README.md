introduction to html &amp; css
This project is based on learning the basics of html and css and applying them creating a web page.
Originally I had planned to create a virtual art gallery but when I saw a documentary on global warming it directed me to do something related to the subject since I found it interesting and I think that by preparing this project I would contribute to inform and raise awareness of how to reverse the impact of  global warming, based on themes such as: recycle, reuse, and reduce.
